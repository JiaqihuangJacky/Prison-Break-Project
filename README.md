Hi there! Welcome to Prison Break

To get you started with this project using C/C++, 
Have a look at the files, and use the terminal to build them by using c++ 11:

    $  g++ -std=c++11 MAIN.cpp IO.cpp Criminals.cpp UI.cpp UI_display.cpp UI_funciton.cpp -o MAIN 
    $ ./MAIN
    
    
This C++ project is the implementation of a data processing
system via data structure. Each record in the system contains a unique key (a string), a secondary key (allow duplicates), and non-key fields. 

Processing is to be menu driven with the following options:
- Add new data, Delete data, Search data (has a sub-menu)
- Find and display one element using the primary key
- Find and display elements using the secondary key (all matches)
- List (has a sub-menu)
a) List unsorted data
b) List data sorted by the primary key 
c) List data sorted by the secondary key
- Special print, as an indented list
- Write data to a file.
- Display Statistics. 
- Quit.
At the end of the program, the file is to be automatically written to a disk file. This is in addition
to the menu write to file option.
